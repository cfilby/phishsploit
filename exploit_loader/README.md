# Exploit loader

Python script used to load the exploit database dump into a PostgreSQL database.

## Dependencies

The Exploit Loader has the following dependencies:

* Python3
* psycopg2 - `pip install psycopg2`
* [exploit-db](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database) - Should be downloaded and extracted.
